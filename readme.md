# The Dollars iOS App 1.0

The current state of the iOS app is in alpha. It is buggy, incomplete and not polished.

### FEATURES:

- Easy access to the Dollars-BBS, Roadrunner Forums (presuming you know the password for both), DRRRChat, Dollars Tumblr Page, and the Dollars World Map.

- Users can switch between pages without worry of losing their history i.e switching from the BBS to the Chat will keep you logged into BBS (and keep the thread open) and switching from Chat to BBS will keep you logged into your chatroom. (This feature has not been tested extensively)

- The map is easy to view, and users can sign in through Google to add their own location to the map.

- This app does not store any data you enter, i.e your google account. It is safe and encrypted, any passwords will be stored via iCloud and the Keychain.

### NOTES:

- To be updated via email on when the latest update of the app is available on GitHub, please enter your email in this form: http://goo.gl/forms/45fH1cbfqxWok8q42
    I will send emails via akatsu.dollars@gmail.com when there is an update available.
- I will answer emails as much as I can so feel free to send me questions, comments, suggestions and (construcive) critisicm!
- Thank you for checking out the iOS app, solely developed by the one and only Akatsu~
